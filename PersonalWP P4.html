    <h1>Welcome to the Rowing page</h1>
    <p>
        The rowing team at Gonzaga is an underrated program, without a doubt. 
        Our team has finished in the top 20 nationally over the past 5 years and is 9 time, consecutive, conference champions. 
        The culture around the team and the coaching staff, makes this program truly unique.

        Last year, I walked onto the Rowing team, having no prior experience.
        It was a tough learning curve, but I am grateful for the opportunity.
        As I learned how to row, set goals, and attack pieces, I learned a lot about myself and my approaches towards challenges in my life.
        I found a love for rowing and the sports I was involved in back in high school, faded away.
        This year, I've had the opportunity to compete in some of the top boats in our program and I couldn't be more thankful for the opportunity.
        Despite the early mornings and frequent soreness, I wouldn't change a thing.
