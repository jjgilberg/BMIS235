    <h1>Welcome to the TVRAS + FGI page</h1>
    <p>
        I applied for a job at the TVRAS + FGI Office about a month before the fall semester of my Freshman year began.
        In this office, I have the opportunity to work with a diverse group of students, representing each of our office's focused populations.
        I send emails, plan luncheons and socials, clean, restock snacks, and do many other small tasks around our office.
        My favorite population to work with is the Returning Adults and Veterans because they are extremely interesting to talk to and always have the best stories to tell.
        Talking to the people that visit this office, makes them more enjoyable and helps the time pass.
