    <h1>Welcome to the Setons page</h1>
    <p>
        Setons is a club at Gonzaga that consists of 30 girls in their sophomore year. 
        Our three pillars that define our organization are service, sisterhood, and leadership.
        As a club, we meet once a week on Wednesday nights at 9 pm and noon on Sunday if you are on the Executive Board.
        Our goal is to foster meaningful relationships with eachother and the Spokane community.
        We foster these relationships through 2 hours of weekly community service in small groups, a full club service project each month, and a monthly social. 
        My role in the club is Service Chair. 
        As the service chair, I organize all of the weekly service placements and plan the monthly service events.
        Setons embodies themes that I am very passionate about and I am grateful for the opportunity to be a part of this amazing group.
